 Lasso Operations Guide

.. only:: html

   These chapters expand on the syntax and language features taught in the
   :ref:`index_language` by first introducing the basic data types in Lasso and
   how to use them. Next are guides to the ways Lasso can exchange file-based
   and raw data with the host operating system, then the standard functions that
   are useful when writing a web-based app, and finally how to have Lasso
   communicate with external services via standard network protocols. These
   should give you a clear understanding of how to start creating web
   applications using Lasso.
