There are many code samples used throughout this guide. References to methods,
types, or traits and small snippets of code inlined with other text are set in a
monospace typeface, e.g. `sample_method` or ``short code snippet``. References
to variable names or to values will be in double quotes "like this".

Longer blocks of sample code will be slightly offset from the surrounding text
and will have syntax highlighting applied to them. The result produced by
running the code will be displayed using line comments. If the result fits on
one line, then a line comment in the form of ``// => Value Produced`` will be
used. If multiple lines are needed, then the first line will just have ``// =>``
while all subsequent lines will start with a line comment and space, followed by
the value for that line. For example::

   // Single-line value produced
   2 + 3
   // => 5

   // Multi-line value produced
   'Line one.' + '\n' + 'Line two.'

   // =>
   // Line one.
   // Line two.

For examples involving running commands from the command line, a shell prompt
(``$>``) will be used. Any output to standard out that is generated from the
command will be shown below the command as you would see it in your terminal.
For examples of issuing Lasso commands from the interactive interpreter, a Lasso
prompt (``>:``) will be used, and any values produced from running those
commands will be shown using the line comment convention as outlined above for
sample code blocks.
