   Every programming language has its own set of rules, characteristics, and
   other aspects that make it unique. Where Lasso stands out is the flexibility
   and clarity of its syntax, allowing the programmer to work with data and
   generate output without the need for repetitive foundational code. It is
   designed to get out of the way and let you focus on your work. This guide
   will walk you through Lasso's syntax and how it implements standard
   programming concepts.
