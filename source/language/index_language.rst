   Every programming language has its own set of rules, characteristics, and
   other aspects that make it unique. Where Lasso stands out is the flexibility
   and clarity of its syntax, allowing the programmer to work with data and
   generate output without being burdened with heaps of foundational code. It is
   designed to get out of the way and let you focus on your work.

   Lasso is also extremely powerful. It allows you to easily perform complex
   operations on data and build reliable, dynamic solutions for the web. This
   guide will walk you through Lasso's syntax and libraries, giving you a clear
   understanding of how to start creating web applications using Lasso.
