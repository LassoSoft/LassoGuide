 Lasso Language Guide
######################

Every coding language has its own set of rules and characteristics; aspects that
make it unique.  Where Lasso stands out  flexibility and clarity, allowing the
programmer to conduct a logical sequence of commands without getting hung up on
extraneous code. It is designed to get out of the way and let you focus on your
work.

Lasso 9 is also extremely powerful.  It allows you to perform complex operations
and build solid dynamic solutions for your web pages.  By reading this section
you will gain a clearer understanding of Lasso syntax, and the proper embedding
methods for creating optimized web pages using Lasso.

Because Lasso 9 provides a great deal of flexibility when applying syntax styles,
it helps to know what works best and why.  This Syntax guide will give a firm
handle on how to apply basic commands, and help you progress into building more
complex processes as you master the language.

.. - `Basic Syntax` addresses the core of the Lasso 9 programming language, and
     summarizes enhancements and improvements over previous versions.
   - `Language Constructs` breaks down the fundamentals of how Lasso handles
     various programming constructs.
   - `Objects and Inheritance` describes the framework for how Lasso processes
     Objects, and defines the Inheritance process for types, variables and tags.

.. Once you read through this guide, it is recommended that you continue reading
   through the subsequent sections. The **Lasso Operations Guide** takes you
   through development of Web and Lasso Applications, as well as system operations,
   working with files and integrating network communications.  The
   **Databases Guide** covers all relevant operations and explains how to work with
   datasources in order to build integrated, dynamically-driven web tools using
   Lasso 9.
