   Every programming language has its own set of rules, characteristics, and
   other aspects that make it unique. Where Lasso stands out is the flexibility
   and clarity of its code, allowing the programmer to construct a logical
   sequence of commands for manipulating data and generating output, without
   being burdened with large amounts of foundational code. It is designed to get
   out of the way and let you focus on your work.

   Lasso 9 is also extremely powerful. It allows you to perform complex
   operations on data and build reliable, dynamic solutions for the web. By
   reading this section you will gain familiarity with Lasso syntax, and a
   clearer understanding of the abstractions required for creating optimized web
   applications using Lasso.
