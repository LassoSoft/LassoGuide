Lasso provides access to the local file system through the file and dir objects.
File objects are used to create, delete, read and write file data. Dir objects
are use to create and delete directories and to iterate directory contents.

Paths
=====

Individual files and directories are identified by their paths. Paths may
include ``..`` or ``.`` components to indicate "parent" or "current" locations,
respectively. Path components are generally separated by forward slashes
although backward slashes are acceptable as well and may be more natural on
Windows operating systems. Regardless of which slash type is used, Lasso will
normalize all paths to match the conventions of the operating system before
using the path in any system function.

Paths can be either relative or full. Full paths always start with at least one
slash, or in the case of Windows, may start with a drive letter designation
(i.e. C:). Full file paths are based from the file system root. When serving web
requests under Lasso Server, the file system root defaults to the web document
root as indicated by the web server for that request (IIS, Apache, etc.) or as
set by the ``LASSOSERVER_DOCUMENT_ROOT`` web request variable. This applies to
the current thread only. Any new threads will not inherit the request specific
file system root.

It is possible to escape the web document root and target the real file system
root by using a full path with either a drive letter designation in the case of
Windows, or by prefixing the path with two additional forward slashes. For
example, ``//foo/bar`` and ``C:\foo\bar`` would both reference the same file on
Windows, provided C: is the system drive.

When not serving a web request, such as when running LassoStartup items or when
running scripts through the ``lasso9`` command line tool, the file system root
is set to the system's natural root which is ``/`` for UNIX-based systems or C:
(for example) on Windows-based systems.

Relative paths do not begin with a slash or drive designation and indicate a
file or directory which is located based on the current working directory.
During a web request the current working directory is equal to the directory
location of the currently active source file. For example, when processing a
request for the file '/foo/bar.lasso', '/foo/' is the current working directory
and a file with a relative path of 'baz.lasso' will be looked for as
'/foo/baz.lasso'. To illustrate, consider the following three example files.
Within the first two are tests checking for the existence of the next file.

.. code-block:: none

   /test.lasso - file 'dir/test.lasso' exists
   /dir/test.lasso - file 'dir2/test.lasso' exists
   /dir/dir2/test.lasso

When not serving a web request or when running scripts via the ``lasso9``
command line tool, the current working directory is as set by the operating
system or shell. In this situation, the current working directory path can be
retrieved with the ``io_file_getcwd()`` method. The current working directory
can be set with ``io_file_chdir(s::path)`` method. Manipulating the working
directory in this way changes it globally for all threads in the current
process.

Working with File Objects
=========================

File objects can be instantiated with or without an initial path. Creating a
file object does not open the file. If created without a path, a path must be
specified when later opening the file.

.. type:: file
.. method:: file()
.. method:: file(path::string)

Opening Files
-------------

A file must be opened before it can be read from or written to. Once a file is
opened it should be closed when it is no longer needed. While Lasso will close
all files which become garbage collected, it is recommended to immediately close
files once their tasks are completed. Many operating systems have limitations on
the number of simultaneously opened files and ensuring that they are closed
promptly will improve system performance.

.. member:: file->openRead()
.. member:: file->openWrite()
.. member:: file->openWriteOnly()
.. member:: file->openAppend()
.. member:: file->openTruncate()

   These methods open the file using the open mode indicated in the method name.
   openRead will open the file in read-only mode. openWrite will open the file
   in read/write mode. openAppend will open the file in read/write mode and will
   set the current write position to the end of the file. openTruncate will open
   the file in read/write mode and will set the file's size to zero.

   Write, append and truncate modes will create the file if it does not exists.
   Read-only mode will fail if the file does not exist.

   All the methods will fail if the process does not have access to the files in
   question. In this case the error_code and error_msg will be set to the values
   generated by the operating system.
   
.. member:: file->openRead(path::string)
.. member:: file->openWrite(path::string)
.. member:: file->openWriteOnly(path::string)
.. member:: file->openAppend(path::string)
.. member:: file->openTruncate(path::string)

   These methods will open the file in the same manner as the preceding methods,
   however these methods allow the file path to be given at the time the file is
   opened.

.. member:: file->openWrite(path::string, okCreate::boolean)
.. member:: file->openWriteOnly(path::string, okCreate::boolean)
.. member:: file->openAppend(path::string, okCreate::boolean)
.. member:: file->openTruncate(path::string, okCreate::boolean)

   These methods will open the file in the same manner as the preceding methods,
   however these methods accept a second parameter. This parameter is a boolean
   value indicating if the file should be created if it does not exist. If false
   is given for this parameter then the file will not be created and a failure
   will be generated using the operating system error code and message.

Closing Files
-------------

Once a file is opened it must later be closed. Once a file is closed it can no
longer be read from or written to unless it is re-opened.

.. member:: file->doWithClose()

   This method requires a givenBlock when it is called. The givenBlock will be
   invoked and then the file will be closed. This is the safest method to use
   when working with files as it will ensure the file is closed even if a
   failure occurs within the givenBlock.

Example::
   
   local(f = file('n.txt'))
   #f->openWrite
   #f->doWithClose => {
     // ... work with file ...
   }

.. member:: file->close()

   This method simply close the file.

Reading File Data
-----------------

File data can be read as either bytes or string objects. By default, string
objects, which are always Unicode, are created with the assumption that the file
contains UTF-8 encoded data. This assumption can be changed by settings the file
objects's character encoding value. When reading the data as a bytes object, the
unaltered file data is returned.

Data can be read line by line or as individual bytes or in chunks of bytes. Each
read will return the bytes immediately following the previously read bytes
unless the file's read/write position is moved. Attempts to read past the end of
the file will return a zero sized bytes object.

.. member:: file->readBytes()::bytes
.. member:: file->readString()::string

   These methods read and return all the remaining data from the file.

.. member:: file->readBytes(count::integer)::bytes

   This method reads up to the requested number of bytes. There may  be fewer
   bytes available than requested.

.. member:: file->readString(count::integer)::string

   This method reads up to the requested number of bytes and attempts to convert
   it into a string object. This method is generally not safe when dealing with
   multi-byte characters as the read end point may come in the middle of a
   character sequence, producing invalid Unicode data.

.. member:: file->marker()::integer
.. member:: file->marker=(m::integer)

   These methods respectively get and set the file object's current read/write
   marker. This value controls where the next read or write will take place. The
   marker value is zero based. Settings the marker to zero moves the marker to
   the beginning of the file.

.. member:: file->encoding()::string
.. member:: file->encoding=(e::string)

   These methods respectively get and set the file object's character encoding
   value. This value controls how the readString method converts the data read
   from the file into a string object. This value defaults to UTF-8.

.. member:: file->forEach()
.. member:: file->forEachLine()

   These methods provide iteration over the file's bytes either one at a time or
   line by line.

Example::

   #f->forEachLine => {
     local(theLine = #1)
     // ...
   }

Writing File Data
-----------------

Data can be written to files using either bytes or string objects as the source.
When writing Unicode string data to a file, the file's encoding value is
utilized. Writing past the end of the file will increase the file's size.
Manipulating the file's marker will adjust where the next write takes place.

.. member:: file->writeBytes(b::bytes)::integer
.. member:: file->writeString(s::string)::integer

   These methods write bytes or string data to the file and return the number of
   bytes which were written.

.. member:: file->delete()

   This methods will delete the file from the system. The file is closed first.

.. member:: file->moveTo(path::string, overwrite::boolean = false)
.. member:: file->copyTo(path::string, overwrite::boolean = false)

   These two methods attempt to move or copy the file to a new location or fail
   trying. The overwrite parameter indicates that if the destination file
   already exists the method should fail.

Other File Operations
---------------------

.. member:: file->exists()::boolean

   This method returns true if the file exists on the system.

.. member:: file->path()::string

   This method returns the path to the file.

.. member:: file->parentDir()::dir

   This method returns a dir object set to the file's parent directory.

.. member:: file->size()::integer
.. member:: file->size=(s::integer)

   These methods get and set the file's size. Setting the size in this manner
   does change the file's size on disk.

.. member:: file->modificationTime()::integer
.. member:: file->modificationDate()::date

   These methods return the raw file modification time as an integer and the
   modification time as a date object, respectively.

.. member:: file->lastAccessTime()::integer
.. member:: file->lastAccessDate()::date

   These methods return the raw file last access time as an integer and the last
   access time as a date object, respectively.

.. member:: file->linkTo(path::string, hard::boolean = false)

   This method attempts to create a hard or soft link of the file at the
   specified location. This method may not be available or may not operate
   consistently across all supported operating systems.

.. member:: file->chown(user::string)
.. member:: file->chown(user::string, group::string)
.. member:: file->chown(uid::integer, gid::integer)
.. member:: file->chmod(to::integer)
.. member:: file->perms()::integer

   These methods are used to set and get the permissions of the file. These
   operations are currently supported on UNIX based systems only.

Standard File Objects
---------------------

Lasso makes the standard in, out and error files available using the following
methods. In general, these file objects should not be closed. The file objects
returned from these methods will not close the underlying system file when they
are garbage collected.

.. method:: file_stdin()::file
.. method:: file_stdout()::file
.. method:: file_stderr()::file

Working with Dir Objects
========================

Dir objects are instantiated with a path and an optional -resolveLinks keyword
parameter. This parameter defaults to false. If set to true, then the dir object
will resolve symbolic links when iterating over its contents, when returning
it's own perms() and when determining if it is indeed a directory through the
isDir() method.

.. type:: dir
.. method:: dir(path::string, -resolveLinks = false)

Creating Directories
--------------------

.. member:: dir->create(perms::integer = integer_bitOr(
                     io_file_s_irwxg, 
                     io_file_s_irwxu, 
                     io_file_s_irwxo)
                  )

   Attempts to create the directory at the path indicated when the dir object
   was created. The perms parameter indicates the permissions that the directory
   should be given. This defaults to the equivalent of rwxrwxrwx.

   This method will attempt to create any non-existent intermediate directories
   along the path with the same permissions. It does not alter the permissions
   of any existing directories.

Iterating Directory Contents
----------------------------

The contents of a directory can be explored in a variety of ways. The contents
can be returned as a series of string paths or as a series of file and dir
objects. Sub-directory contents can be returned recursively.

The paths of sub-directories produced by these methods will have a trailing
forward slash. A dir object never returns a path or object representing the ".."
or "." directory entries.

Each of the values returned by these methods can be used in query expressions or
in iterate(...). A dir object itself can be utilized in a query expression or
iterate. In this case, the behavior will be the same as with the eachPath()
method, described below.

.. member:: dir->eachPath()
.. member:: dir->eachFilePath()
.. member:: dir->eachDirPath()

   These methods are used to list the relative paths of the contents of the
   directory. eachPath will return both files and sub-directories. eachFilePath
   and eachDirPath return only the file or sub-directory paths, respectively.

.. member:: dir->eachPathRecursive()
.. member:: dir->eachFilePathRecursive()
.. member:: dir->eachDirPathRecursive()

   These methods are used to list the relative paths or the contents of the
   directory. When a sub-directory is encountered, its contents are also listed,
   and so on as deep as the directory tree goes.

.. member:: dir->each()
.. member:: dir->eachFile()
.. member:: dir->eachDir()

   This set of methods returns the directory contents as file or dir objects.
   The each() method returns both the files and dirs within the directory.
   eachFile and eachDir return only the files or dirs, respectively.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Use a dir object in a query expression to list the contents of the current
working directory::

   with path in dir('.')
   select #path // is a string such as 'foo/'

Use a dir object to list a directory's contents as file objects::

   iterate(dir('foo/')->eachFile, local(f))
     #f // is a file object
   /iterate

Other Dir Operations
--------------------

.. member:: dir->moveTo(path::string)

   Attempts to rename, or "move", the directory. A failure is generated if the
   operation fails.

.. member:: dir->delete()

   Attempts to delete the directory. A directory must be empty before it can be
   successfully deleted. A failure is generated if the operation fails.

.. member:: dir->exists()::boolean

   This method returns true if the directory exists on disk.

.. member:: dir->path()::string

   Returns the dir's path.

.. member:: dir->parentDir()::dir

   This method returns the directory's parent directory as a dir object.
