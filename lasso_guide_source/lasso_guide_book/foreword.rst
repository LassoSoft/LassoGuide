Lasso has been around for decades, and will be around for decades to come.

Although other languages have become known as the more "popular" languages, the
criteria used to measure popularity have rarely been challenged. Lasso came out
of the Mac world---a world filled with artists, educators, and medical
practitioners---in the nascent days of the Internet. It has been used by a wide
variety of people, whether they be occasional programmers, hard-core developers
or anything in between. It has been used to create systems which support and
manage the Internet, to drive billions of dollars in sales, and to monitor
simple everyday life events.

Lasso presented the world with a novel and logical way to script, develop, and
write code poetry. Tens of thousands of people owe their livelihoods to Lasso,
and almost all live their lives unaware of Lasso's importance. Lasso has become
a foundation block of the world's digital future, steadily inspiring joy and
value to those who use it regularly.

This latest version of Lasso, Lasso 9, makes a monumental leap in its underlying
theory and architecture to secure the future of the platform. With countless
hours of effort, a group of dedicated contributors have worked together to
ensure that a strong central manual---a canon---would exist for this new
language. These individuals include:

| Kyle Jessup
| Fletcher Sandbeck
| Jonathan Guthrie
| Paul Higgins
| Brad Lindsay
| Steve Piercy
| Michael Collins
| Aaron Smalser
| Eric Knibbe

It is with great pleasure that I thank this group for their concerted and
tireless efforts over several years to bring this endeavour to bear. May this be
the book which shines a light for the Lasso development community, allowing it
to be seen from around the world and shared with others.

Long Live Lasso!
