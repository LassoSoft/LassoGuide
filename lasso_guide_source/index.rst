.. Lasso Guide documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Tue Jul 31 01:26:58 2012.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. Eventually I'd like to replace this front page with something nicer-looking
   that uses the full page width.

Lasso is a powerful programming language used to drive millions of web pages
from servers around the world. It has an easy-to-master syntax and allows fast,
flexible development and scripting. Lasso can be used in many ways, but as a
language provides a virtually infinite set of shortcuts for completing
development goals.

What follows is a living set of documentation for the Lasso 9 programming
language. As this documentation will change or be improved over time, please
regularly review during your development and feel free to ask questions or make
suggestions for improvement. Send and and all requests or suggestions to
docs@lassosoft.com; we will review and answer as soon as possible.
