Lasso is a powerful programming language used to drive millions of web pages
from servers around the world. It has an easy-to-master syntax and allows fast,
flexible development and scripting. Lasso can be used in many ways, and as a
language, provides a virtually infinite set of shortcuts for achieving
development goals.

This guide is meant to serve as both an introduction and comprehensive manual to
Lasso and Lasso Server |version|. The material in this guide will evolve and
improve along with Lasso. The most up-to-date version of this documentation
containing all improvements can be found at `<http://lassoguide.com/>`_.


.. rubric:: Organization of This Guide

This guide is divided up into eight parts covering all aspects of the Lasso
programming language.

-  :ref:`book-get-start` introduces the basic features of the Lasso language and
   server, as well as instructions for installing and configuring Lasso.

-  :ref:`book-language` covers the syntax and features of the Lasso language.
   Read this thoroughly for a complete understanding of how Lasso code is
   structured.

-  :ref:`book-data`, :ref:`book-input-output`, :ref:`book-development`, and
   :ref:`book-communication` detail the capabilities of the libraries that ship
   with Lasso, divided into appropriate categories. Method definitions and
   examples of common use cases are included.

-  :ref:`book-databases` describes Lasso's database connection interface. Basic
   database operations as well as pointers about specific database types are
   covered.

-  :ref:`book-extending` includes tutorials and references for adding your own
   functionality using Lasso's C and Java APIs.

Explanations, method definitions, and code examples are arranged within the text
to teach you the Lasso platform step-by-step. An index is also available to help
find information about a particular language element.
